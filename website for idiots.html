                           <doctyping> But really,are you actually an idiot, or are you just stupid? I know you just stumbled upon this website somehow, and you're like, "Being an idiot isn't the same as being stupid." Well, YOU'RE WRONG! Being an idiot is about annoying people and even more annoying people. Being stupid is that you aren't smart. See? DIFFERENCE!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! Um, yeah. 
                  <doctyping> I don't know why I am making this website, maybe it's because i've always wanted to make a website. I don't know, why are you here then?!
